# Codename Runtime (cname_runtime) a testing game engine

Project was made in 2015/2016. Old project of mine.
It is just a testing ground for different 3d stuff.

Project is an amateur hobby project of mine.
The project is made because I want to create a game that runs on low-powered computers, this has a target as the Beaglebone Black rev C.

The project uses these libraries: 
-SDL 1.2.x
-OpenGL 1.2
-TCL 8.6

It is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3

HOW-TO:
Move to the src/ folder, and then run "make"
The engine will be built, and then Qualker.emc will be the executable (game) binary.
If any problems, please report back. And also check if you have all the required development libraries.
